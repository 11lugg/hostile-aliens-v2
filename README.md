# Hostile Aliens

This is the second time I have completed this project. The first time, I completed it using JS, HTML and CSS. It was an opportunity to learn OOP before I began to learn React. 

This second iteration was created using React JS. I wanted to practice passing props to components and render the results on the page.

Focus was put on functionality over the look.

# Dream

The design is very basic and I would like to style. Personally, functionality has been a weak area for me, so having the opportunity to practice has been invaluable in my development.
